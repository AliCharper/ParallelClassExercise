Parallel Class in .NET 6 explained


The Parallel class is a class in C# that provides methods for parallel programming.Parallel programming is a way of writing code that can execute multiple tasks at the same time on different threads or cores.

The Parallel class has three main static methods:

•  Parallel.For: Executes a for loop in which iterations may run in parallel 

•  Parallel.ForEach: Executes a foreach loop in which iterations may run in parallel

•  Parallel.Invoke: Executes multiple actions in parallel

These methods can help you improve the performance and responsiveness of your applications by using all the available CPU resources (learn.microsoft.com). However, they also require careful synchronization and error handling to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

To use the Parallel class, you need to add a using directive for the System.Threading.Tasks namespace at the top of your code file. You also need to pass a delegate (such as an anonymous method or a lambda expression) that represents the work to be done in parallel. Optionally, you can also pass an instance of the ParallelOptions class that specifies some options for parallel execution, such as cancellation tokens or maximum degree of parallelism.


I have tried to just make these things a little bit more clear by some examples. Beside that, you can follow this chain of articles about Parallel class in .NET
